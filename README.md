# Sonic Robo Blast 2 Web
This is a web port of Sonic Robo Blast 2 that was formerly hosted on surge.sh. The original files were retrieved and archived here so the game can still be played.
The port only has version **2.2.13** as a test, so any features or mods created for future versions may or may not work. 
I am not the creator of this port, so any issues you may encounter I cannot fix.
OpenGL graphics do not work.
Originally hosted by vinnie. Fork created by megakookie.
